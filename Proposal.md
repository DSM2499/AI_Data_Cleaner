# AI-Powered Data Cleaning Assistant: Project Proposal

## 🧩 Problem Statement

In data-centric organizations, analysts and data scientists spend an estimated 60–80% of their time cleaning and preprocessing data before any meaningful analysis can begin. Raw datasets frequently contain:
- Missing, duplicated, or inconsistent values
- Encoding issues and malformed date formats
- Inaccurate or invalid data entries
- Column misclassifications (e.g., numbers stored as strings)

This overhead not only delays project timelines but also introduces variability and error depending on the individual performing the cleaning. There is a pressing need for a unified, intelligent, and user-friendly data cleaning tool that can quickly inspect a dataset, identify issues, and suggest or auto-generate remedies.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
I propose building an AI-powered Data Cleaning Assistant that automates the data profiling and cleaning process using natural language generation and intelligent heuristics. The assistant will:
- Accept raw CSV datasets via a Streamlit web interface
- Perform intelligent data profiling using ```pandas``` and ```pyjanitor```
- Identify common issues (nulls, duplicates, type mismatches, etc.)
- Use a language model to generate:
    - A summary of the detected issues
    - Python code snippets to clean the dataset
    - A bullet-pointed action plan for the user
- Display all outputs directly in the UI (rather than the terminal)
- Allow users to copy or download the generated Python cleaning script

## 🏗️ Implementation Plan

### 🔧 Technology Stack
- Frontend/UI: Streamlit
- Backend: Python
- AI: Open AI GPT for code generation and summaries
- Validation: Great Expectations

### 📈 Expected Impact
- Time Savings: Reduce manual data cleaning time by 60–80%
- Data Consistency: Standardize cleaning logic across teams
- Upskilling: Help junior analysts learn cleaning best practices by example
- Accessibility: Lower the barrier for non-programmers to prepare data

## 📎 Summary
This AI Data Cleaner project empowers users to transform messy data into usable form with minimal effort. By intelligently profiling datasets and generating contextual cleaning code, the assistant saves time, reduces errors, and enhances data usability for analysis and modeling.
